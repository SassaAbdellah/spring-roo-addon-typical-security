You will see a line as follows, which indicates addon has been installed

`[  72] [Active     ] [    1] spring-roo-addon-typical-security (0.1.4.BUILD-SNAPSHOT)`

= Uninstallation =
{{{
$roo > addon remove --bundleSymbolicName com.xsoftwarelabs.spring.roo.addon.typicalsecurity
}}}
= Usage =
{{{
$roo > project --topLevelPackage com.test --projectName `TestProject`

$roo > persistence setup --database ... --provider ....

$roo > typicalsecurity setup
}}}

Alternatively, you can provide options to typicalsecurity setup
{{{
$roo > typicalsecurity setup --entityPackage ~.model --controllerPackage ~.web
}}}
Once you have injected Typical Security
{{{
$> mvn tomcat:run
}}}
and go to http://localhost:8080/TestProject

This will take you to login page, login using "admin" and "admin". You will see Controllers for `UserModel`.

Create `UserModel` with a email address and password.

Now logout and login using newly created `UserModel`'s email address and password.

1. Creates Entity classes namely `UserModel`, `RoleModel`, `UserRoleModel`

2. Create Controllers for `UserModel`, `RoleModel`, `UserRoleModel`

3. Run "security setup" addon

4. Inject Database based Authentication Provider into applicationContext-security.xml

5. Project "/" url with access `IsAuthenticated()`
