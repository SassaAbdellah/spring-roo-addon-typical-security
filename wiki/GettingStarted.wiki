`[  72] [Active     ] [    1] spring-roo-addon-typical-security (0.1.1.BUILD)`

= Uninstallation =

$roo > addon remove --bundleSymbolicName com.xsoftwarelabs.spring.roo.addon.typicalsecurity

= Usage =
$roo > project --topLevelPackage com.test --projectName `TestProject`

$roo > persistence setup --database ... --provider ....

$roo > Typicalsecurity setup


Alternatively, you can provide options to Typicalsecurity setup

$roo > Typicalsecurity setup --entityPackage ~.model --controllerPackage ~.web

Once you have injected Typical Security

$> mvn tomcat:run

and go to http://localhost:8080/TestProject

This will take you to login page, login using "admin" and "admin". You will see Controllers for `UserModel`.

Create `UserModel` with a email address and password.

Now logout and login using newly created `UserModel`'s email address and password.

1. Creates Entity classes namely `UserModel`, `RoleModel`, `UserRoleModel`

2. Create Controllers for `UserModel`, `RoleModel`, `UserRoleModel`
